			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>
				Caf√© Aurelia is a family owned business and we work together to bring
				you the best experience possible. My name is Ryann Von Der Becke and I
				started this business so I could create something with my daughters,
				Lily, Emma and Chloe and my husband Robert. Together we create new menu
				ideas, visit local events and spend time bonding as a family and with
				the community. We love creating something special and sharing it with
				others. We can't wait to see you soon!
